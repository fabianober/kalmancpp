     * KALMAN FILTER DEMONSTRATION
     * ===========================
     *
     * Scenario: We have a sensor that should read a constant value of 5.0,
     * but the sensor has noise, so readings vary around the true value.
     *
     * Goal: Use a Kalman filter to get a better estimate of the true value
     * by filtering out the noise from multiple measurements.
     *
     * The Kalman filter will:
     * 1. Start with an initial guess (we'll start at 0.0 - deliberately wrong)
     * 2. Process each noisy measurement
     * 3. Gradually converge to the true value (5.0)
     * 4. Become more confident over time (lower uncertainty)
     */

    // Create a simple Kalman filter
    // Parameters: initial_estimate, initial_error, process_noise, measurement_noise
    /*
     * PARAMETER EXPLANATION:
     *
     * initial_estimate = 0.0
     *   Our first guess of the true value. We deliberately start wrong to show convergence.
     *
     * initial_error = 1.0
     *   How uncertain we are about our initial guess. Since we started at 0 but expect
     *   the true value to be around 5, an error of 1.0 means we think the true value
     *   is likely between -1 and +1 initially (which is wrong, but the filter will learn).
     *
     * process_noise = 0.01
     *   How much we expect the true value to change between measurements.
     *   Since we're measuring a constant value, this should be small.
     *   Small Q means "the true value is very stable."
     *
     * measurement_noise = 0.1
     *   How noisy our sensor is. Looking at our measurements (4.8 to 5.2),
     *   they vary by about Â±0.2 around the true value, so R=0.1 is reasonable.
     *   This tells the filter "measurements typically have noise of about 0.1"

     * 2. UNCERTAINTY REDUCTION: The final uncertainty should be much lower than
     *    our initial uncertainty (1.0), showing the filter gained confidence.
     *
     * 3. NOISE FILTERING: The filtered estimates are typically closer to 5.0
     *    than the individual noisy measurements.
     *
     * 4. OPTIMAL BLENDING: Early measurements have more influence (big corrections)
     *    because our initial uncertainty was high. Later measurements have less
     *    influence because we've become more confident in our estimate.
     *
     * This demonstrates the key benefit of Kalman filtering: optimal estimation
     * under uncertainty by balancing predictions and measurements!
